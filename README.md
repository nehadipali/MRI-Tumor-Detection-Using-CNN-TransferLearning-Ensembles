# MRI-Tumor-Detection-Using-CNN-TransferLearning-Ensembles
Application of Convolutional Neural Networks in Brain Tumor Segmentation

The National Cancer Institute estimates that 24,530 patients will be diagnosed with brain cancer in the United States in 2021. Of those diagnosed, the estimated 5-year survival rate is approximately 32.6%. Early and accurate detection of brain tumors can lead to better treatment plans and patient outcomes. Currently the industry standard for brain tumor diagnosis is through a radiologist’s interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). As interpretation of MRI scans can be prone to human error, we have developed a solution using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify the presence of three kinds of brain tumors — gliomas, meningiomas and pituitary tumors. Our project explores and compares different CNN approaches to classifying brain tumors in the above 3 categories. Our findings indicate that ensemble techniques can be used to identify the tumors with a very high degree of accuracy.

The project considered the use of the following neural network models - 
- 2D-CNN Model
- Transfer Learning Models - VGG16, RESNET152, INCEPTION V3
- Transfer Learning Models with final convolutional layers retrained 
- Ensemble Methods
